    <p>Chicago’s Jail Is Top U.S. Hot Spot as Virus Spreads Behind Bar<br />s
So we are 44 days into the US epidemic, and 30 days since the mandatory Social Isolation Control (SIC) lockdowns.  All 2.3 million US prisoners are all locked down and cannot do and have not done social distancing, and yet only 32 deaths?  Maybe mandatory social mixing is much better than mandatory social isolation!
At least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails across the United States, according to data tracked by The Times, including at least 32 deaths.</p>
